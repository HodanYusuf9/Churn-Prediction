# Churn-Prediction

## Short description

In today's world, intense competition environment is expanding and companies desire to retain their customers. Especially banking is also one of the competitive field. While customer relationship activities get up to date for a competitive advantage, customer analytics comes into prominence. Thus, churn analysis and prediction are quite significant in order to capture the signals of potential churn customers and prevent this loss. Thanks to classification algorithms, various models could be built up for churn prediction. In this study, several algorithms are used for churn prediction and evaluated their performances.

## Models Used
Several classification algorithms are established according to serve the purpose of churn analysis. In the study, three algorithms have been studied which are logistic regression, random forest and decision tree. All these algorithms are used for modelling classification and prediction of churn customers. Training dataset is used for learning and test dataset is used for prediction in all models. The best classifier for the dataset is Random Forest, which gives %85 accuracy score. In others words, it provides to opportunity to prevent losing every 85 customers among 100 customers
